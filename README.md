# Machine-Learning-Prediction-Models-for-Mechanically-Ventilated-Patients
Built machine learning models using the MIMIC-III database, achieving top performance with Random Forest (AUC: 0.984) and XGBoost (AUC: 0.981) to predict ICU mortality and identify key predictors like lactate levels and severity scores. 
Designed robust preprocessing pipelines and delivered actionable insights to optimize risk stratification and ICU resource allocation, recommending XGBoost for clinical deployment.
